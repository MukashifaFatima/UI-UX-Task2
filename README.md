# UI-UX-Task2
A low-fidelity wireframe showing the basic user flow of a food delivery app. 
These lo-fi wireframes illustrate the main user flow for a Food Delivery App, including login, signup, browsing restaurants, selecting menu items, cart management, order confirmation, payment, and order tracking. 
The wireframes use minimalistic grayscale elements to focus on structure, navigation, and essential functions without visual distractions.
Key interactions like adding items to the cart, confirming orders, and tracking delivery status are clearly represented for intuitive user experience.
